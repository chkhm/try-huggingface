# Try ðŸ¤— HuggingFace!

This repository is a fork from: Alfredo Deza's Coursera training: [Try Huggingface](https://github.com/alfredodeza/try-huggingface)

You can either run this in a devcontainer or just plain and simple with:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip -r requirements.txt
```

Then just open the folder with VS Code, reject starting a devcontainer, browse to the Jupyter Notebooks, and open them. You could of course also just open them with a jupyter notebook.

The Devcontainer potentially also run in github code space, but I have not yet tried.

Here are the original instructions from Alfredo:

Examples to try HuggingFace datasets and transformers

* Search the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for existing models
* Install the [Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/) Python package from the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file
* Install the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) Python package from the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file

Browse through the [Jupyter Notebook examples](./notebooks).
